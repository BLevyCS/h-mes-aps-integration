# LMS

LMS integration involves the RtdsMonitorService and the stored procedures in it. If the service is installed and the stored procedures are created, the service, while running, will capture all statuses for equipment that is OEE enabled.

# ACM

ACM integration can be achieved with the documentation, and the sql scripts in this folder.
